//EnableDamageSystem- This is for if you want to disable the damage system, if it's false it will be default GTA health system.
//EnableBetterAI- This will enable if the plugin will take control of peds attacking the player and make them behave more realistic.
//AIAccuracy- This is a value of 1-100 this sets the peds accuracy to that number. 100 meaning they have aimbot, 5 being they could'nt hit a house if they tried.
//EnablePanic- This sets if the panic button when you fire is enabled.
//PanicCooldown- This is the time (In seconds) that it will wait after before shooting will trigger another panic button.
//Keep in mind the default 150 seconds is a pretty good time.
