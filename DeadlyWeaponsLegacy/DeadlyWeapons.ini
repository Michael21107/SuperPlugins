//EnableDamageSystem- This is for if you want to disable the damage system, if it's false it will be default GTA health system.
//EnableBetterAI- This will enable if the plugin will take control of peds attacking the player and make them behave more realistic.
//EnablePulloverAI- This will enable better pullovers. Shows a notice if the player sees a weapons and increases the chance of resistance if a ped is wanted.
//EnablePanic- This sets if the panic button when you fire is enabled.
//AIAccuracy- This is a value of 1-100 this sets the peds accuracy to that number. 100 meaning they have aimbot, 5 being they could'nt hit a house if they tried.
//PanicCooldown- This is the time (In seconds) that it will wait after before shooting will trigger another panic button.
//Keep in mind the default 150 seconds is a pretty good time.

//ADVANCED SETTING!!
//This is the time in MILLISECONDS that the plugins runs! This includes checking all nearby peds!
//By default it runs every 250 milliseconds (4 times a second).
//Making the value lower will have the plugin run more often, and can make it track peds better, though with a slow system it will cause huge lag spikes!
//Alternatively increasing this will make the game run smoother, but can cause peds to not be tracked correctly.

//Using a high end system, I notice lag if I go lower than 150. With an average system 250 is perfect. With a slow system 400 will reduce lag.
